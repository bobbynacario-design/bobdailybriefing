# Bob Daily Briefing

Private daily intelligence briefing desk for Bob.

## OpenAI generation

The browser app does not call OpenAI directly. It calls the Firebase callable
function `generateBobDailyBriefing`, which keeps the API key server-side.

Setup:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\AO\projects\bobdailybriefing\functions
npm install
firebase functions:secrets:set OPENAI_API_KEY --project pokerhq-a67e4
npm run deploy
```

After deploy, sign in to the app and use `OPENAI GENERATE`.

Notes:

- ChatGPT Pro is a ChatGPT subscription, not the API endpoint.
- This app uses the OpenAI API through Firebase Functions.
- The default model is `gpt-5.5`; override with `OPENAI_MODEL` if needed.
